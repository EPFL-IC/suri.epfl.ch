The Rowhammer vulnerability common to many modern DRAM chips allows attackers to trigger bit flips in a row of memory cells by repeatedly accessing the adjacent rows at high frequencies. As a result, attackers can corrupt sensitive data structures (such as page tables, cryptographic keys, object pointers, or even instructions in a program), and circumvent all existing defenses even if no software-level vulnerabilities are present.  

In this talk, I'll discuss the Rowhammer vulnerability and how it can be exploited. I'll also introduce ZebRAM, a novel and comprehensive software-level protection against Rowhammer. ZebRAM isolates every DRAM row that contains data with guard rows that absorb any Rowhammer-induced bitflips; the only known method to protect against all forms of Rowhammer. Rather than leaving guard rows unused, ZebRAM improves performance by using the guard rows as efficient, integrity-checked and optionally compressed swap space. ZebRAM requires no hardware modifications and builds on virtualization extensions in commodity processors to transparently control data placement in DRAM. This way, ZebRAM manages to provide strong security guarantees while still utilizing all available memory.
