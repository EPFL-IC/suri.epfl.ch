In this talk, I will present and discuss recent novel techniques for scalable privacy-preserving computing with high numerical precision. Apart from well-known applications to engineering and scientific problems (such as satellite collision detection), high-precision computing on large datasets is becoming relevant to machine and statistical learning systems designed to detect rare events (such as fraud transactions in FinTech, predictive maintenance in manufacturing, or rare diseases in healthcare). I will describe an approach based on Fourier transforms that allows to evaluate efficiently various non-linear functions in the setting of secure multi-party computations (SMPC). Finally, I will present a novel practical and scalable data-independent approach to compiling privacy-preserving programs that is applicable to both SMPC systems and fully-homomorphic encryption (FHE) systems.
