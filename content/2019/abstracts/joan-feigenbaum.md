The Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) has launched a new effort in the nascent field of Computer Science and Law.  In order to stimulate interest in the area and to articulate a broad and compelling agenda, ACM will hold an inaugural Symposium on Computer Science and Law at New York Law School in the Tribeca neighborhood of New York City on October 28 - 29, 2019.  This talk will address challenges and opportunities in research, education, and institutional structure that are presented by ACM's efforts in this area.
