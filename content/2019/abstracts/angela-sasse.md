In the security industry, it has become a meme that 'people are the problem', because they don't comply with policies and make 'bad decisions'. Security experts have tried to change this by running security awareness programmes, and trying to identify some factors within humans that makes them 'better security citizens.'  This talk will present insights from the 2019 ENISA report on security behaviour change. In a nutshell,  past and current attempts to change security behaviour by awareness or selection is ineffective because the behaviour is driven by impossible demands and conflicts with productivity goals.  Since productivity is paramount in all but a number of organisations, we describe the current state of affairs by paraphrasing management scientist Peter Drucker's dictum that 'Culture Eats Strategy for Breakfast' as 'Productivity eats security for breakfast, lunch and dinner'.'Based on the ENISA report and other recent studies reseach, I will outline new thinking and skills that security sprecialists need to develop security solutions that survive first contact with the real world.
