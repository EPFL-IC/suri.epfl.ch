The main aim for any electronic identity (E-ID) system is to enable internet users to identify themselves securely and correctly. The ever-growing global digitalization shows that more and more people are opting and execution various transactions on the internet which require full identification. Thus, the E-ID needs to, without doubt, provide the necessary means for exact identification of a particular user. Requirements for E-ID systems vary depending on the country and jurisdiction, and in Switzerland, the core component of issuing the electronic identity is to perform official checking and confirmation of a personâ€™s existence along with their identifying features such as name, sex, birthday, etc. On the other hand, to support a broad expansion and secure usage of E-ID, the underlying system needs to be carefully designed and implemented.
