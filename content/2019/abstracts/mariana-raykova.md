In this talk I will overview latest developments in several areas of advanced cryptography which constructs tools that enable protection of private data while computing on it. 
I will focus on the efficiency perspective covering existing implementations and systems using these tools. I will talk about examples in the areas of secure multiparty computation,
differential privacy and zero knowledge proofs.
