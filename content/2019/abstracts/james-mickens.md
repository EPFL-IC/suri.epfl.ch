Trusted hardware attempts to provide software with silicon-guaranteed security, for some definition of "security." Unfortunately, modern trusted hardware is either too simple to provide rich notions of security (see TPM chips), or is so complex that the secure hardware itself is vulnerable to microarchitectural exploits (see SGX and TrustZone). In this talk, I will give an overview of these tragedies, and then propose a series of increasingly outlandish approaches for designing hardware that provides non-trivial security properties without exposing a large hardware-level threat surface. Depending on the audience's reaction, I will then be elected the mayor of Lausanne, or I will be chased into the ocean and forced to swim back to America.
