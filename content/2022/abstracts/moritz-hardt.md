Algorithmic predictions steer markets, drive consumption, shape communities, and
alter life trajectories. The theory and practice of machine learning, however,
has long neglected the causal forces of prediction. A recent conceptual
framework, called performative prediction, draws attention to the difference
between learning from a population and steering a population through
predictions. After covering some emerging insights on performative prediction,
the talk turns to an application of performativity to the question of power in
digital economies.
