Classical algorithms typically provide "one size fits all" performance, and do
not leverage properties or patterns in their inputs. A recent line of work aims
to address this issue by developing algorithms that use machine learning
predictions to improve their performance. In this talk I will present some
examples of results this type, in the context of streaming and sampling
algorithms. In particular, I will show how to use machine learning predictions
to improve the performance of a sampling algorithm for estimating the number of
distinct elements in a data set, and a streaming algorithm for counting
triangles in a graph.
