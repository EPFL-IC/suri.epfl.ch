Inverse problems occur in a variety of parameter identification tasks in
engineering. Such problems are challenging in practice, as they require repeated
evaluation of computationally expensive forward models. I will discuss some
recent work with collaborators which introduces a unifying framework of
multilevel optimization that can be applied to a wide range of
optimization-based solvers. Our framework provably reduces the computational
cost associated with evaluating the expensive forward maps stemming from various
physical models. To demonstrate the versatility of our analysis, I will discuss
its implications for various methodologies including multilevel (accelerated,
stochastic) gradient descent, a multilevel ensemble Kalman inversion and a
multilevel Langevin sampler.
