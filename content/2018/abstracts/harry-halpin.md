For years, real-world encrypted messaging was limited to using the IETF PGP standards, featuring cutting-edge 90s crypto combined with a horrific user interface. With the advent of the Signal Protocol, encrypted messaging finally hit widespread usage. However, a number of important research problems remain unsolved. First, although the vast majority of messaging is between groups rather than point-to-point, Signal and similar protocols do not handle group messaging well. Second, users are forced to identify with unique device IDs and, while the message itself is encrypted, there is no anonymity, including from the centralized server as well as any adversary observing the incoming and outgoing messages. In this talk, we'll outline the new effort for Message Layer Security at the IETF and how these problems of privacy and decentralization can be tackled, with ramifications far beyond secure messaging to areas as diverse as Ethereum and IoT.
