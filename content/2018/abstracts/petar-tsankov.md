In this talk, I will present Securify [https://securify.ch], the first security analyzer for smart contracts that is scalable, fully automated, and able to prove contract behaviors as safe/unsafe with respect to a given property. A key observation of this work is that it is often possible to devise precise patterns expressed on the contract's data-flow graph in a way where a match of the pattern implies either a violation or satisfaction of the original security property. In terms of verification, a key benefit in working with patterns, instead of with their corresponding property, is that patterns are substantially more amenable to automated reasoning. Based on this insight, Securify uses a set of patterns that mirror the satisfaction/violation of relevant security properties. To check these patterns, Securify symbolically encodes the dependence graph of the contract in stratified Datalog and leverages off-the-shelf scalable Datalog solvers to efficiently (typically within seconds) analyze the code. 

A demo version of Securify is publicly available at https://securify.ch. Since the release, the public version of Securify has had more than 22,000 uses and is regularly used by security experts to perform professional security audits of smart contracts.
