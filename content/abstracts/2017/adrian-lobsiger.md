When it comes to the topics of machine learning and robotics many authors use the term of «artificial intelligence». From my perspective as a privacy commissioner data processing is so far «artificial» as it is a cultural act, which can vary strongly with regard to the technical devices applied and the speed, quantity, quality or complexity of the processing. 
In my opinion existing legal principles do cope with any of those characteristics of data processing regardless of the technology it is based on. The rule of law satisfies the need of society to determine a responsibility of the humans who were last perceived in control of a process and it will always give way to solutions in order to reach this goal. 
Even if my prediction showed to be wrong: If we lost the last bit of control to “something” other than a "human" or deliberately handed power over to it one day, among us humans, the last of "us" in the chain would be held responsible, rather than the "thing" which gathered control over our data.
