<p>As the capabilities of censors increase and their ability to perform more powerful deep-packet inspection techniques grows, more powerful systems are needed in turn to disguise user traffic and allow users under a censor's influence to access blocked content on the Internet.  Decoy routing is a censorship resistance technique that hides traffic under the guise of a HTTPS connection to a benign, non-censored 'decoy' site. However, existing techniques far from perfectly disguise themselves as a typical access of content on the decoy server.  Differences in latencies, packet sizes, and timings betray their use to a censor capable of performing basic packet and latency analysis.</p>

<p>While many of the more recent decoy routing systems focus on deployability concerns, they do so at the cost of security, adding vulnerabilities to both passive and active attacks. We propose Slitheen, a decoy routing system that hides censored data inside actual traffic from the decoy sites, perfectly preserving the traffic characteristics.  Our system is secure against previously undefended passive attacks, and known active attacks. Further, we present our latest work demonstrating how to securely support route asymmetry in decoy routing systems like Slitheen, as well as a tiered deployment strategy to remove barriers to ISP participation in censorship-resistance deployments.</p>
