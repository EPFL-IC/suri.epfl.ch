<p>The internet was built without strong privacy protections, making its use today susceptible to routine mass surveillance. Our research for the past 15 years has focused on building scalable protections for on-line communications that hide content, but also "anonymity systems" that hide the meta-data of who is talking with whom on-line. In this talk I will provide an overview of our latest results in attacking widely deployed anonymity systems, and present our latest designs, showing that such systems can be made robust at scale. Anonymity systems are relevant not only for communications privacy, but also as building blocks for private queries, social networking and private storage, and are likely to become a fundamental building block of information security in the years to come.</p>
