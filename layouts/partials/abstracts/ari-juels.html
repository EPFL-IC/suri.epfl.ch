<p>Transparency is one of the distinguishing and attractive features of blockchains. It is at odds, however, with another key feature desired by practitioners: Confidentiality. In this talk, Iâ€™ll introduce Solidus, a practical system for blockchain transactions that harmonizes these two seemingly contradictory features within a framework used by real-world financial institutions. Solidus uses a new primitive called PVORM (Publicly Verifiable Oblivious RAM Machine) to hide both transaction values and the blockchain transaction graph (i.e., the identities of transacting entities). At the same time, it offers public verifiability of transaction validity and transparency for auditors. A preliminary implementation shows that Solidus can achieve practical throughputs and a high degree of scalability.</p>
