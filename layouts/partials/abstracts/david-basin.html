<p>Routing is at the heart of the Internet and has been a continual source of security problems since its expansion in the 1980s.  SCION is a new approach to the Internet, which offers dramatically better security properties than we currently have.  We describe a collaborative effort, the Verified Scion Project, at ETH Zurich that aims to verify Scion, going the full distance from high-level network-wide properties down to the code running on SCION routers.  We will explain the issues involved, the approach we take, the progress we have made, and  perspectives for the future.</p>

<p>The work reported on is joint work between three groups at ETH Zurich: my Information Security Group, the Network Security Group of Adrian Perrig, and the Programming Methodology Group of Peter Mueller.</p>
